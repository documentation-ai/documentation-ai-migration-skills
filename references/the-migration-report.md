# The migration report

Generate the implemented migration report set: gate JSON, Markdown review queue and summary, redirect and anchor JSON, platform-gaps.json for engineering follow-up, and the customer-facing HTML/PDF report of what was migrated and what was not.

Run `documentation-ai-migrate report` after verification. It summarizes the single machine-readable gate dataset and decision log. Report generation is automatic and is not a separate human gate; final cutover approval remains gate 4/4.

Outputs currently implemented: `report/gates.json`, `report/review-queue.md`, `report/summary.md`, exact/wildcard redirect JSON, anchor JSON, `report/platform-gaps.json` (aggregated T4/T6/T7 decisions and anchor-shim count), and the customer report as `report/customer-report.{html,pdf,json}`.

Engineer-notes enforcement, CSV annexes, performance comparisons and cutover-plan generation are future work. Do not claim those artefacts exist.

Never ship raw markdown or model output to a customer. The customer report below is the artefact to send; every other file in `report/` is written for the team.

## The customer report

`report/customer-report.pdf` is the only artefact written for the customer, and it answers two questions: what arrived, and what did not. It is written for someone who has never seen a migration: the front pages carry one verdict sentence, four numbers, a numbered list of the decisions the customer needs to make (one plain sentence each, with up to three example page names and no addresses), a "good to know" list of things that changed without needing them, and a five-line "checks at a glance". Every full list — page addresses, link targets, the run's own words for a check that did not pass — sits in an appendix at the back, for the people who act on it. Links pointing at pages outside the migration are counted by the page they point at, not one line per link.

The second is the point. A migration that omits pages and reports only its successes is worse than one that names them, because the customer finds out from a reader. So the report accounts for each of these, with the reason the run recorded at the time (itemised in `customer-report.json`):

- every page the plan did not migrate, grouped by reason (unpublished, not placed by the table of contents, out of scope);
- every page held back at conversion (an unresolved snippet, or content exact mode refused to approximate);
- every page migrated but absent from the sidebar, because the source publishes it without placing it;
- every block of content removed from inside a page, attributed to the rule or person that decided it;
- every link still pointing at the old site, because its target is outside the agreed scope;
- every check that failed or did not run — a permissive run states that it proves nothing about fidelity rather than showing those checks as passed.

A help-centre hub the migration wrote (`nav --help-center`) is listed as a page the migration wrote, with its approver: it holds no words of ours. Items needing a customer decision come first. An appendix list longer than 200 entries states how many it is not showing and points at `customer-report.json`, which holds the full set; nothing is truncated silently.

Gate ids never appear. Each is rendered in the customer's terms (`code-blocks-exact` → "Code samples are character-for-character identical") by `report/gate-language.ts`; a gate with no entry there falls back to its raw id, so add one when adding a gate.

`report --summary` writes the reader's version instead: the verdict, the numbers, each decision and note as one plain sentence, and the checks at a glance, with no appendix, no page or link addresses and no build detail. Nothing leaves the counts; every list stays in `customer-report.json`. Use it for the copy a customer reads; the full report is for the people acting on it.

The PDF is printed from the HTML by the same headless Chrome verification already uses — no extra dependency, no network, scripts disabled. If Chrome is absent the stage still writes the HTML and JSON and says how to finish the job; it never fails the report over a missing browser. `--no-pdf` writes the HTML only.

## Provenance and per-route results
`report/summary.md` records which migrator build produced the output (commit, whether the checkout was dirty, and the hash of what differed), the fidelity mode and the navigation source. `verify --preview` writes `report/preview-routes.json`: one row per deployed route with its residual rendered text and any link, image, heading-outline or sidebar problem. `report/unlisted-pages.json` lists pages the source publishes without a sidebar placement.
