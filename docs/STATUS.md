# Implementation status

Last updated 17 September 2026 (see the dated entries at the end). Verified by `npm run typecheck`, the unit tier (`npm test`), the exactness proof tier (`npm run test:proof` against a saved real Mintlify site) and end-to-end CLI runs over the synthetic Document360 export, Mintlify fixture repository, and generic smoke repository.

## Measured performance

Run with `npm run test:scale` (`DAI_SCALE_PAGES` sets the corpus size). Generated generic-repository
corpora, one machine, exact mode:

| Corpus | discover → nav | verify | heap needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 500 pages | 8s | 5s | under 512 MB |
| 5,000 pages | 18s | 48s | 384 MB; fails at 256 MB |

Peak RSS on the 5,000-page run is about 1 GB unconstrained, which measures what the machine had
free rather than what the run needed: with the heap capped at 384 MB the same run completes, and at
256 MB it exhausts the heap while parsing a page. Verification streams the snapshot a page at a
time for this reason; the stages that rewrite every page still hold the corpus.

## Implemented and verified

- Portable Codex/Claude plugin manifests and 13 operator skills whose text matches the code.
- External `0700` workspaces, resumable stage state, stable page and node identities, redacted decision logs, plans pinned by hash, convert-level determinism (two converts over identical inputs must hash identically).
- Content contract extracted from the product repos and reconciled by decision (`packages/content-contract`), with a strict validator (editor-only nodes, unknown components, invalid enum props, expressions, ESM, residual source syntax, multi-line evasion folded).
- **Sources**
  - Document360 export ZIP or directory (HTML and Markdown articles, hardened extraction, snippet tokens with `blocked` mode).
  - **Mintlify repository**: `docs.json`/`mint.json` recursive navigation (versions, languages, tabs, anchors, dropdowns, products, groups, pages), redirects (exact now, trailing wildcards as `:splat` candidates), group-level `openapi` copied and attached, `snippets/*.mdx` imports inlined, `{#custom-id}` headings, site name (the source's logo, favicon, colours and theme are recorded but not carried).
  - **GitBook Git Sync repository**: `.gitbook.yaml` root, structure and redirects; `SUMMARY.md` sections and nesting; missing and unlisted files reported; Liquid `hint`, `tabs`, `embed`, `content-ref`, `stepper` outside code.
  - **ReadMe**: sync repository (`docs/<category>/*.md`, frontmatter `title`, `slug`, `excerpt`, `hidden`, `order`, `parentDocSlug`) and API v2 client (paginated categories, guides and reference with bodies; wired into `discover` when `README_API_KEY` is set).
  - Generic local Markdown/MDX/HTML repositories, and live sites via discovery (robots-declared/conventional recursive sitemap indexes and gzip URL sets ∪ ordered sidebar links ∪ recursive same-origin links ∪ optional Firecrawl map) with the SSRF-guarded fetcher or Firecrawl batch scrape. Fetch order: native sources first, then the built-in fetcher (the default: robots, SSRF checks, DNS pinning, 2 rps per host, content-addressed cache), then Firecrawl batch scrape only when `--fetcher firecrawl` is passed with `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` set, for large, rate-limited or client-rendered sites. Sitemap provenance, order, SEO fields, hreflang, and conservative section/locale/version hints are retained in `inventory/sitemaps.json` and `plan/tree.yaml`; sidebar/path evidence takes precedence.
- Component definitions scanned from `snippets/`, `components/`, `src/components/`, `custom-blocks/` and attached to signatures, so custom components cluster per definition.
- Markdown/MDX parsing with GFM, literal-only props, no JavaScript evaluation; single-line JSX elements promoted to block components; inline runs under flow elements kept as paragraphs.
- Component Conversion Engine: declarative mappings per platform, T0–T4 deterministic, T5 static only, T7 sanitised fragment or quarantine, `drop` rules with subtree ledger marks, per-cluster plan decisions honoured (approve, exclude, quarantine).
- Assets: download, hash dedupe, SVG sanitisation, `s3` provider (tested with an injected client), `dai-api` provider (wired to the presign/confirm endpoints; blocked until the platform accepts API-key credentials there), failed entries retried.
- Verification: 37 release gates including verification against the raw acquired source (`source-content-exact`, `source-metadata-exact`, `html-reconciliation`, `chrome-absent`), navigation compared against a fresh extraction from the frozen source, route-by-route preview comparison, migrator provenance pinning, and block-level ledger coverage, prose and code/table parity, contract validation, navigation, links, redirects, plan pinning, gates bound to the output hash, convert-level determinism, preview contract version, rendered anchors in headless Chrome with resolver pinning.
- Git writer: `refs/heads/migration/<session>`, isolated worktree, host-bound org allowlist (GitHub and GitLab, subgroups), no force-push, protected-branch refusal.
- Reports: gates, review queue, summary, redirects, anchors, platform gaps, cutover runbook, sitemap list, search canary.
- Human review is consolidated into exactly four standard gates: scope/structure, conversion plan, pre-push validation, and preview/release. Ambiguity and failed automated checks are exception states, not additional approvals.

- Connection is settled at `init`: remote policy, reachability (`git ls-remote`) and **push access** (a dry-run push that deletes a ref which does not exist, so credentials are proven without changing the remote; a failure names the fix: `gh auth login && gh auth setup-git`, or registering the SSH key), API key, the project's connected repository compared with the remote by branch set, live deployment branch, prior previews, media API, and the asset provider to use; results in `report/preflight.json` and the session. `write --push` clones the remote when no `--repo` is given, then polls `/api/v1/deployments` until the migration branch's preview is ready and records its URL (with a diagnosis when none appears). `verify --preview` uses the recorded URL; the contract version is read from the platform when exposed and otherwise assumed from the pinned version, marked as such in `report/connection.md`.

## Boundaries

- GitBook API export (`format=markdown`) and variants/sections from `gitbook-docs.yaml` are not implemented; map them in `plan/tree.yaml`.
- ReadMe: OpenAPI uploads, variables/glossary substitution and Changelog → Update are not implemented; Recipes convert only when the body is present.
- Mintlify: `.jsx` snippets and snippets used with props remain source components for review; SDK reference generation is not implemented.
- `dai-api` asset ingestion targets the API-key media surface `/api/v1/media/*`, implemented in the backend working tree on 10 September 2026 (pending review and deploy); until deployed the provider probes once and fails fast with the reason, and `assets-ready` keeps release blocked. See `docs/platform/media-api.md`. The same backend change exposes `contentContractVersion` on `/api/v1/config`.
- Preview deployments are created by the product's branch workflow; the preview contract version must be supplied until the product exposes it.
- Customer PDF renderer and annexes, screenshots and performance scoring, external-link checks, and T6 AI rule proposals remain future work.

## Testing

Two tiers. `npm test` runs the unit tier (`packages/*/test/**/*.test.ts`): self-contained tests over small synthetic inputs with neutral content that reproduce each structural trap (duplicate sidebar placement, `sidebarTitle` ≠ title, description blockquote next to an authored blockquote, `⌘I` chrome, fenced code with meta, cross-host sitemaps, llms.txt double listing). `npm run test:proof` runs the proof tier (`packages/*/test/proof/**/*.proof.test.ts` through `vitest.proof.config.ts`, excluded from `npm test`): the exactness proof against the saved raw source of a real site, reached only through `DAI_SOURCE_TRUTH_DIR`, a directory holding `truth.json`, `llms.txt`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `html/` and `md/`. That source lives outside this repository, so no customer or demo content is vendored here; the proof run fails immediately, naming the variable and the missing file, when the directory is unset or incomplete. `packages/migrate-core/test/helpers/source-truth.ts` loads and types `truth.json` (`loadTruth`, `pageByPath`, `chromeStrings`); `test/helpers/fixture-fetcher.ts` serves the saved site to the `Fetcher` (`fixtureFetcher`, both site hosts) and a synthetic in-memory site for the unit tier (`syntheticSiteFetcher`), each recording every requested URL. Every proof assertion has a synthetic counterpart in the unit tier so `npm test` proves the mechanism without the external source.

## Exact fidelity

`init --fidelity exact` (the default) is the mode for a customer migration. What it
guarantees, and where each guarantee is enforced:

| Guarantee | Enforced at |
|---|---|
| Title, description and sidebar label come from the source's own statements, never a URL or a theme-decorated `<title>` | `discover`, `inventory`, gate `source-metadata-exact` |
| Every page the source publishes is migrated; none is invented | `discover`, gates `pages-accounted`, `source-content-exact` |
| Body blocks match the published source in count and order | gate `source-content-exact` |
| The rendered page and the published Markdown agree on images, links, code languages and the heading outline | gate `html-reconciliation` |
| No platform chrome reaches the output | gate `chrome-absent`, profile `chromeStrings` |
| Group labels, order, nesting and repeated placements match the source, cross-checked against a fresh extraction | gate `navigation-exact` |
| Missing published Markdown, an unhostable asset, an authored exclusion or a lost placement stops the run | `acquire`, `assets`, `convert`, `nav` |
| The deployed preview renders the source's content and nothing else | gate `browser-content`, `report/preview-routes.json` |
| The output was produced by the migrator build the session pinned | gate `migrator-pinned` |
| A second convert over the same inputs is byte-identical | gate `deterministic-rerun` |

Permissive mode runs the same pipeline and reports the exact family as `not-run`.

## Testing

- `npm test` — unit tier. Synthetic inputs only; no network and no customer content in the repository.
- `DAI_SOURCE_TRUTH_DIR=<dir> npm run test:proof` — exactness proof against a saved capture of a real
  documentation site held outside this repository. It runs the pipeline offline, asserts the output
  against the site's own `truth.json`, and reintroduces each loss a real migration once shipped to
  confirm the gates fail. The command fails, rather than skipping, when the variable is unset.

## Source evidence hardening

Discovery now pins a separate source manifest. Native repositories/exports are frozen before conversion reads them. Mintlify config entries, GitBook SUMMARY links, ReadMe files and the live sitemap/llms/sidebar union supply page identities independently of the editable migration tree. Missing pages, substituted identities, duplicate output ownership, extra output files and unresolved quarantine block source-universe certification. Scope exclusions are attributed and pinned at conversion. Completed live/API acquisitions have a separate session-bound record-hash index; Firecrawl HTML uses the common acquisition checks and generated Markdown is not treated as published source.

Limitations: this is page-universe and byte-integrity evidence, not an independent semantic AST/DOM witness. Raw live index HTTP bytes are not yet separately pinned (the parsed discovery result is pinned). Document360 category enumeration and ReadMe API pagination completeness remain blocking implementation gaps. Native-source navigation/content proof gaps are not exempted. No customer migration or preview is certified by synthetic tests.

## 2026-09-15 — three parallel migration branches integrated

Merged `fix/gitbook-link-graph-scope`, `migrate/mintlify-docs` and `migrate/flare-help-centre` (the latter two carrying the shared `fix/hosted-asset-fidelity` work). The auto-merge duplicated two things both branches had invented independently — `withinSiteBase` and the site-base confinement in `discoverLiveSite` — reconciled to one rule: everything outside the site's base is refused except what a sitemap the site itself serves declares. `mergeNavigation` (Mintlify scoped sidebars) and `mergeNavigationTrees` (GitBook per-section sidebars) still coexist; unifying them is a follow-up.

Fixed on top: a container's own page is its `path` (not a duplicate child); Mintlify `hidden` containers and `menu` items; `\u0026` in Flare TOC titles; URL case preserved; the Flare copyright line no longer reaches the topic; Mintlify and GitBook endpoint pages carry `openapi:` frontmatter over assembled or captured specs under `api-reference/`; `#param-` links follow parameters to the platform's anchors; GitBook `<picture>` unwrapped; GitBook `prompt`, `file`, `br`, `esm` mapped; `nav --help-center`; the strict validator reads multi-backtick code spans.

## 2026-09-16 — gates re-run against the real captured workspaces

The three 2026-09-15 migrations were re-derived offline from their frozen captures (copies of the GitBook and Mintlify workspaces, on the integrated build) and every remaining gate failure was traced to its cause in the source bytes rather than waived. What changed:

- **Verify read the two sides differently.** The output normaliser padded a code span with spaces and the source side did not, so `(oneOf / anyOf)` and `( oneof / anyof )` were "different prose"; a `<kbd>` was padded the same way; a code fence nested more than eight spaces deep (Steps › Expandable › CodeGroup) was invisible to the code-block gate; a heading's badge text (`### \`navigation\` <Badge>required</Badge>`) was in the output outline and not the source's; a Card's title, a PreviewButton's label become, was not read as prose; `~~strikethrough~~` markers were compared as text. The source side now renders inline content exactly as the serializer writes it and the output side reads titles and key caps as the reader sees them. Mintlify prose misses went 2427 → 0-order and tables 100 → 0; GitBook prose 823 → single digits.
- **Anchors.** The platform gives a Step title rendered as a heading its own id (Steps.tsx); verify now counts it, which closed every GitBook stepper deep link. Mintlify's heading ids (dots and spaces to hyphens, badge text included, `( ) , * :` dropped, repeats `-2`, `-3`; derived from 9,773 rendered headings) are recorded as the source id so a link written against them gets its shim. An empty `<div id>` is an anchor and is written as one instead of quarantined. Source HTML no longer has slugged anchors invented for headings that publish their own id, so a link the source itself had broken is reported as inherited, not charged to the migration.
- **A title the export escaped.** llms.txt labels and tree titles are Markdown link text, so `\[updated for 2026\]` there is `[updated for 2026]`. The title is unescaped wherever it is read: published Markdown, llms.txt, a frozen discovery, and the frozen acquired record the metadata gate compares against.
- **GitBook pages an operator had excluded "for the preview run".** Thirty-one pages could not be read into MDX: a brace in prose or a table cell, a `{% openapi %}` quoted in escaped backticks, a paragraph opening with `import`, `{% file %}` never closed, footnotes, and an embed URL whose tail the export left outside the autolink brackets. Each is now read as the author's text (braces escaped outside code and tags, `import` written with its first letter as a character reference on both sides, footnotes carried as GFM footnotes with their anchors, `file` self-closing, the URL re-joined). All thirty-one convert.
- **`unmigrated-links`** counts only links to pages under the docs' own base (derived from the tree's pages, not the sitemap, which lists the marketing site too) and lists links to served files (`llms.txt`, sitemaps, `.md` exports) without failing.
- `internal-links` with no tree context no longer classifies every broken link as inherited.
- `plan` extends an existing URL plan with the default entry for every page the tree gained since it was written (a lifted scope exclusion, a page a rerun discovered); before, such pages had no route and convert skipped them silently. A rule that writes a link by the operator's decision (a live-demo card) records it in the ledger, and `unmigrated-links` counts it apart. GitBook's inline search and assistant buttons are chrome, inline and as blocks.
- A link nested inside a link (Mintlify's export writes `<a href="mailto:x">[x](mailto:x)</a>`) is written once, as a browser shows it; a link fragment is matched to its heading after percent-decoding (`#…-%24ref` is `$ref`); a prompt copies its whole text, numbered lists included, and the prose gate looks for a prompt's sentences in the code block the ledger says they became; `inventory` names the page a parse failure happened on.

Gate counts on the re-derived copies, before this batch → after (permissive sessions; `assets --provider none`):

| Gate | Mintlify (1050 pages) | GitBook (1224 → 1255 pages) | MadCap (427 pages) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prose-match | 827 → 0 | 505 → 0 | 0 |
| fragments-resolve | 1029 → 0 (1009 inherited, listed) | 758 → 0 (775 inherited, listed) | 0 |
| no-unresolved-blocks | 384 → 0 | 6 → 0 | 0 |
| headings-sequence | 8 → 0 | 5 → 0 | 0 |
| tables-exact | 11 → 0 | 12 → 0 | 0 |
| code-blocks-exact | 12 → 0 | 0 | 0 |
| internal-links | 9 → 0 (9 inherited, listed) | 77 → 0 (9 inherited, listed) | 0 |
| unmigrated-links | 43 → 0 (23 beside the docs, 20 declared by rule) | 20 → 0 (7 beside, 17 files) | 0 |

The only failures left on a rerun are `human-gates-approved` (the tree changed since the approval, by design), `migrator-pinned` (an uncommitted build) and, on GitBook, `assets-ready` under `--provider none`. The thirty-one GitBook pages excluded on 2026-09-15 are in the 1255.

## 2026-09-16 — MadCap landing-page tiles

A Flare help centre landing page lays its section links out as a grid of tiles (`div.procedure-tiles` holding `a.procedure-button` links). They reached the output as a column of underlined links. The MadCap profile now recognises the grid as a card group of four columns and each tile as a card whose title is the tile's label and whose link is its target; the generic mapping table carries `CardGroup` and `Card` for any profile that recognises them. An inline element a profile recognises is a block of its own, and a label lifted whole into a prop is not written as the card's body too. The landing pages' tab strip (`.tab-wrapper` of `.tab-item` links) is written as cards too, the current tab without a link and its mobile duplicate dropped; the landing header (`.home-nav-header`: logo and "Developers Center") is chrome and removed.

A landing page's tile menus (`<ul data-mc-linked-toc="Data/Tocs/x.js">`) are empty in the HTML and drawn in the browser from tables of contents the page names. Discovery now captures every linked TOC a page names (with its chunks) into the frozen navigation data, and convert writes each menu as the list of links it draws, cut at `data-mc-max-depth`. A capture taken before this change holds no such data, and the page is held (quarantined with the reason) rather than written with an empty tile: on the 2026-09-15 the Flare help centre capture that is `reference` and `releasenotes/release-notes`; a fresh `discover` captures them. Selectors in profiles accept `:not(...)`.

## 2026-09-16 — a group's landing page is the group's page, on every source

A container whose first page is its landing page (named as the container is, or at the container's own route or its directory's index, with other pages still beneath) is written with that page as its `path` instead of a same-named first child. Flare topics with subtopics and GitBook parent pages already did this from the source's own statement; the rule now covers sources that only imply it (Mintlify groups, generic repositories). On the re-derived copies: 17 the Flare help centre containers, 11 Mintlify containers, 0 GitBook (its parent pages were already the group's). A container's only page is never lifted, and a site's root page under its first group is not that group's landing page.

## 2026-09-16 — customer report rewritten for a non-technical reader

The report's front pages were a wall of page addresses, one line per broken link, and thirty-seven check rows. They now carry one verdict sentence, four numbers, the decisions the customer must make as numbered plain sentences with a few example page names, a "good to know" list, and a five-line checks summary. Every full list moved to an appendix at the back. Skip reasons are said in the reader's words; links to unmigrated pages are counted by target page, named as a reader would name them. On the the Flare help centre copy the front matter went from 245 lines of text to 75.

## 2026-09-16 — the frozen source universe stops at the site's base path

Discovery refuses a same-origin URL outside the site's base path (`www.mintlify.com/pricing` beside `/docs`) as another site on this host, but the live source manifest still listed every sitemap entry as a published page of the source, so `source-universe-accounted` asked for a decision on 272 marketing pages that were never candidates (permissive runs never showed it; the first exact run did). The manifest now leaves out what discovery refused. Because a frozen manifest is never rewritten, an offline re-derivation may make exactly this one correction — drop pages discovery refused, change nothing else — and refuses anything more, so an existing workspace fixes itself with `rebase --reason … && discover --offline` and no re-crawl.

## 2026-09-16 — a failing gate is a finding, never a lock on the preview

`write --push` no longer refuses on failing automated gates or on a missing gate-3 sign-off, in any mode. Scope and plan approvals (gates 1 and 2) are still required, since a push without them would publish an unreviewed scope; everything verify found is written to `report/pushed-with-findings.json`, printed at the push, and carried in the review queue and the customer report; `release` (gate 4) is where a finding blocks. `verify` marks itself done and offers gate 3 whether or not gates failed.

## 2026-09-16 — the exact family on gitbook.com

The first exact-mode run on gitbook.com failed fourteen gates. Each traced to one cause:

- GitBook's export writes every heading as `\u200bTitle <a href="#id" id="id"></a>`; read as text, the id was lost and the slug changed, so 345 deep links had no target. The anchor is now the heading's source id (the site states it), the zero-width space is dropped. An expandable's summary is an anchor GitBook publishes too and gets its shim.
- The card table's `<h4>` + `<p>` cell became one run-on title; the heading is the title and the paragraph the body, which also reconciles the rendered headings of every guides hub.
- A figure's caption was written as an italic line, so the file read back as an image plus a paragraph (175 pages). The platform's Image carries `caption`; a plain caption rides on it and reads back as the figure.
- A titled fence with no language wrote `title="…"` as its first word, which reads back as the language; it now writes `text`, which the platform renders an unlabelled block as, and the comparator reads `text` and no language as one.
- An inline element alone on its line (`<mark>…</mark>`) read back as a flow component; on this tool's own output it is the paragraph it was.
- A step whose first line is a bold heading did not fold into the Step title; a bare address and a link showing it differed only by percent-encoding; both fold now.
- Rendered headings that are the theme's own strings ("Test it (powered by Scalar)") or the operation summary the platform generates from the page's spec are not expected in the file; `Name<mark>*</mark>` reads as the words a reader sees.
- A wildcard redirect that agrees with every exact rule beneath it is the same rule said once, not a shadow (3,994 issues on one site). A heading the source itself heads with chrome words ("Table of contents") is authored. GitBook's search button is chrome like its assistant button.
- Section sidebars were merged in the order pages finished downloading, which no rerun repeats, so the written navigation and the re-read differed; both now merge in address order with one section-assignment rule.
- A step's leading heading that carried a published anchor lost it when the heading became the Step title; the Step now carries that anchor inside it. GitBook's export escapes punctuation inside Liquid attribute values (`title="a\_b.py"`); the value is the characters. A wildcard redirect candidate must agree with every exact rule beneath its prefix at any depth (`/docs/*` never covers `/docs/documentation/fr/…`). A link to a path the source never published was broken before the migration and is listed with the inherited links, not counted as a page left behind. Bold or italic text that begins or ends in punctuation (`**［完了］**をクリック`) is written as `<strong>`/`<em>`, since CommonMark cannot delimit it there; the reader restores it. A caption is always written as the platform Image's words, and a caption that had formatting is a recorded loss. GitBook's derived heading ids have changed over time (`Azure AD` → `azure-a-d`, `GitBook's` → `gitbooks`); every spelling is an alias.

## 2026-09-16 — the three migration branches integrated a second time

`migrate/gitbook-handbook`, `migrate/mintlify-manual` and `migrate/flare-help-centre-fresh` each kept fixing their own site after the first integration; all of it is on `main`, reconciled where two branches changed one thing differently:

- A figure's caption of words alone rides on the platform Image's `caption` prop and reads back as the figure (GitBook); one that names a link or carries formatting is written as the italic line under the picture, Markdown and all, so nothing is lost (Mintlify). The comparator reads both.
- An attribute value is quoted with the mark it does not contain (the deployment refused `&quot;` inside `"…"`) and writes `<` and `>` as character references (the preprocessor read one as a tag).
- A heading keeps every anchor the source published on it; a Step keeps the anchor its folded title carried, inside the step.
- Every asterisk and underscore in text is escaped; a line-leading asterisk is no longer escaped twice (`\\*` read back as a backslash on five gitbook.com pages).
- A page bound to an OpenAPI operation stays its own navigation entry rather than becoming its container's landing `path`: the platform reads the operation from a page entry only.
- Scope decisions carry asset exclusions (GitBook) and accepted witness differences (Mintlify) side by side.
- The customer report keeps its front page and appendix; `report --summary` writes the reader's version without them. It says when unlisted pages were placed by decision, when links to content outside the migration keep working because the old site stays online, when a substitution lost nothing, when a deep link opens its page at the top, when pages were left out by an agreed scope decision, and leaves a separate help system's pages out of "not migrated".
- `write --push` is never withheld on a failing gate, in any mode; the docs and `--help` now say so everywhere they said otherwise.

Re-derived offline on the merged build: mintlify.com/docs (1050 pages, 0 quarantined; every gate a permissive run can pass passes), a MadCap Flare help centre (427 pages; the two pages held are landing pages whose linked table of contents this older capture never froze, which a fresh capture carries), gitbook.com/docs (1255 pages, 0 quarantined).

## 2026-09-17 — finishing touches, three ways to deliver, and a preview check nobody has to fight

**The site's look travels.** The platform's own settings schema is copied into the content contract (`packages/content-contract/documentation.schema.json`, 22 settings, the navigation grammar, 1,826 drawable icon names) and the written `documentation.json` is validated against it; an unknown key is an error because the platform would ignore it silently. `plan` proposes `plan/site.yaml` from what the source says about itself (a Mintlify site's embedded `docs.json`; a GitBook page's head and header): brand colour per scheme, logo, favicon, top-bar button and links, SEO statements, the template (`init --template classic|atlas`), the finishing stylesheet, redirects. `nav` writes it and pins it. Redirects are now written into `documentation.json`; before this they were computed and reported but never deployed.

**Navigation says what the source says.** `method` on every page bound to an operation (the platform draws the GET/POST badge from it alone); icons translated to the platform's Lucide names (an untranslatable one is left out and said so, because an unknown name renders nothing); Mintlify `tag` as `badge`, page `mode` as layout switches; hidden containers kept and flagged rather than dropped; tabs and languages in the source's own order (they were in crawl order); labels letter for letter from the source, sentence case only where the source states none; the help-centre hub in every language, titled in that language.

**Three ways to deliver.** `init --clone <folder>` takes the remote from the owner's own clone, needs no `--target`, no `--allowed-orgs` (the write is scoped to that repository's organisation) and no API key; `write --push` then says where to read the preview URL, and `verify --preview-url` remembers it. `publish` sends the same output through the platform's Authoring MCP server (`src/publish/`): files first, then settings and navigation in steps the platform's drift guard accepts (it refuses a write that drops more than a quarter of the navigation's paths, which replacing a starter site always would), one publication, then the preview. `assets --provider none --keep-external --by "<who>"` records a named decision to leave pictures at their current addresses when no image hosting exists. `documentation-ai-migrate mcp` serves the CLI to any MCP host over stdio.

**The preview check fails only what a reader would miss.** On the real 1,046-page preview the old check failed 509 routes, 83 deep-link targets and 294 layout readings, and none of them was a fault in the migration. Re-run over the same stored renders, the new check fails none and notes 492; over live HTTP, 60 pages take 8 seconds. What it now tolerates, each measured on that site: passages the platform respells (`{x}` in inline code shown as `&#123;x}`, a description's backticks drawn as code), code samples it rewrites in places (options stripped from a fence shown inside an example; a literal `\n` turned into a line break), its own labels and pills, reordering, theme links, links it draws from an API description, links already broken on the source, pages no navigation entry names, heading ids that equal the source's own rather than the predicted one, sideways scroll. What still fails is pinned by tests: a page that does not load, a lost paragraph, a lost code sample, a lost heading, a stated link into nothing, `/null`, a missing sidebar placement. `accept --route … --by` records a person's acceptance of a finding; the finding stays in the report under their name.

Proved offline on the captured workspaces, new build against old, gate for gate: mintlify.com/docs (1,046 pages written, 0 quarantined, only the two gates every re-run fails), gitbook.com/docs and a MadCap Flare help centre identical to their previous results apart from the wording of `assets-ready` and `plans-pinned`. The key-free clone flow is tested end to end through the real CLI against a local stand-in for the git host.

**Not yet proven, and said plainly:** `publish` has not run against the live Authoring MCP server (its test stand-in enforces the platform validator's two rules, copied from the backend's own code). The platform refuses a navigation that names one page twice on MCP writes (`duplicate_path`), which the git flow's deploy accepts; the GitBook and the Flare help centre outputs have such pages. A repository-committed image is not served by the platform (a relative `src` resolves against the blob CDN), so the clone flow cannot self-host pictures.

**For the platform's owners** (found while measuring, none fixable from here): link-only dropdown and menu items render `href="/null"` (patch prepared); `mdx-preprocessor.ts` replaces every literal `\n` in a page with a line break, code samples included, and rewrites braces inside inline code after mis-pairing a four-backtick span; pages with a wide `<Image>` scroll sideways on a phone and a desktop (the layout readings name the image and its `inline-block` wrapper as what widened them); the public docs say `css` where the deploy reads `customCss`.

## 2026-09-17 — the MCP flow needs no API key

Whoever migrates into a Documentation.AI project already has an account that can edit it, so `publish` signs them in the way every MCP host does: discovery from the documents the server publishes (RFC 9728, RFC 8414), self-registration as a public client (RFC 7591), the browser, a loopback callback, PKCE (`src/publish/mcp-oauth.ts`). The token lives in the process's memory and is never written anywhere. An account that can edit several projects names one with `--project`; it is remembered for the migration, and the project's ids travel on every call rather than through the server's remembered selection, which is shared by every MCP host the account uses. `DAI_API_KEY` remains for a machine nobody sits at.

Read from the platform's code: publishing a working version through MCP runs the same push service as the editor's Save, which starts the preview build itself; the webhook path that previews a pushed branch skips platform-authored commits, so nothing else would. The MCP server returns no preview address yet (announced for its next version), so without a key the address is read from the dashboard. Also: a redirect whose source is the site root is no longer written (the platform applies redirects before `initialRoute`, so every visit would be permanently redirected), and with only `DAI_API_KEY` set the API address defaults to the public platform.

Checked live, read-only: the discovery documents of `api.documentation.ai/mcp` parse (issuer `clerk.documentation.ai`, registration endpoint present, PKCE S256). The sign-in itself and `publish` have not run against the live server.

## 2026-09-17 — the MCP flow chooses its project before pictures are hosted

The first real MCP-flow run (41 pages, 44 pictures, released) showed a gap: the project was chosen at `publish`, after `assets` had already stored the pictures under whichever project `DAI_DOCUMENTATION_ID` named. They displayed, and they were filed in another project's storage folder, where that project's media library lists them and deleting that project deletes them. `documentation-ai-migrate project` now runs right after `init` in the MCP flow: it signs the person in and records the project. `assets --provider s3` refuses to run in the MCP flow until it has, stores under the chosen project, and stores an asset again when the migration's project changes. `publish` stops, with the steps to take, when hosted assets sit under another project's folder.

What this does not change: only Documentation.AI's own team can host pictures today, because the platform has no upload route for a project key or a sign-in (`/api/v1/media` answers 404) and the Authoring MCP server has no media tool. A customer on their own records the decision to leave pictures at their current addresses.

## 2026-09-18 — the sidebar carries icons a source has nowhere to state

Documentation.AI draws an icon beside every sidebar row that carries one, and the documentation the
platform itself publishes carries one on every page and every tab. The migrator only ever read icons
from a Mintlify `docs.json`; navigation discovered from a rendered sidebar captures a link and its
text and nothing else, so a GitBook, Docusaurus or ReadMe source migrated into a sidebar of plain
rows that reads plainer than the same pages written in the editor, for a reason no reader can see.
Measured on two real workspaces: the Mintlify migration wrote 24 icons, the GitBook one wrote none,
and the GitBook source's own sidebar has none to carry — only a chevron.

`plan/site.yaml` now carries `icons: suggested | source | none`, proposed as `suggested`, and `nav`
applies it to the built navigation (`src/nav/icon-suggest.ts`). A proposal is read from the entry's
own title through an ordered phrase table and a word table modelled on the platform's own pairings
(`Getting Started` → `rocket`, `Billing` → `credit-card`, `Migrate from GitBook` → `book-marked`, a
changelog's year groups → `calendar`). Four properties make it safe to write before a person sees
it: an icon the source states is never replaced; every name is checked against the contract's 1,826
drawable names, so nothing is written that the renderer draws as nothing; the mapping is a table, so
a re-run writes a byte-identical file; and within one container the pages either all carry an icon
or none do, since a half-iconed container has ragged rows. A workspace planned before the setting
existed reads as `source`, so re-running `nav` on it writes what it wrote before.

`navigation-exact` had to change with it. It compared the written navigation byte for byte against
the reviewed tree, so any proposed icon read as a structural difference and failed gate 3. It now
compares structure with icons set aside, and compares icons separately in one direction only: every
icon the source states must arrive, unchanged, at the same entry. A dropped icon, a changed icon and
a structural difference all still fail, each covered by a test.

Proved on real workspaces, not only in tests: `nav` re-run on a copy of the 41-page GitBook
migration proposed 53 icons, `verify` passed every gate including `navigation-exact` (the only
failure is `migrator-pinned`, which every re-run against a newer build fails), and a second `nav`
produced the identical file by sha256. The same pass over the captured 400-page Mintlify workspace
adds 487 icons beside the 24 the source states, with no schema issue.

## 2026-09-18 — pictures are hosted through the sign-in, with no key and no bucket

Until now only Documentation.AI's own team could host pictures (`--provider s3`, the platform's storage keys). A customer on their own could only leave pictures at their current addresses, because the platform had no upload route for a key or a sign-in and the Authoring MCP server had no media tool. The platform now has both (backend `feature/media-mcp`, not yet deployed), and the migrator uses them.

`assets --provider dai-mcp`, now the default whenever no bucket is configured, signs in as `project` and `publish` do and hosts each picture through the MCP tool `import_media`, ten per call: the platform fetches the file from its public address itself and runs a dashboard upload's checks on it. Each stored file's size is compared with the captured copy; in exact mode a difference is refused, since the hosted file would not be the one certified. A picture with no public https address, a cleaned SVG, a file the platform could not fetch, or a size difference goes as captured bytes through `POST /api/v1/media` when `DAI_API_KEY` and `DAI_API_BASE` are set, and otherwise fails naming the reason. Batches are paced under the platform's 120 files a minute per organisation, and a file refused for rate is retried after the wait the platform names. Hosted URLs record their `org-<id>/doc-<id>` storage path, so a change of project re-hosts them exactly as with `s3`.

`dai-api` targeted presign and confirm endpoints that were never built; it now uses the real multipart route, matching results by order. The backend's `import_media` gained a `source` field on each stored file so results can be matched to what was sent.

Proved through the real CLI on a copy of the 41-page GitBook migration (44 pictures) against a stand-in for the MCP server and the REST route that answers in their real shapes: five batches of at most ten, one rate-limited file retried after the named wait, one changed file and one unfetchable file refused with their reasons; a second run with a key uploaded exactly those two as captured bytes; a third run sent nothing. Convert, nav and verify then passed `assets-ready` with 43 platform-hosted URLs in the pages and none on the source host. **Not yet proven against the live platform**, which does not have the media tools until the backend is deployed.

## 2026-09-22 — the media path is live on the platform, and the repository is ready to be seen

The backend behind `assets --provider dai-mcp` is deployed. `import_media`, `search_media`,
`list_media`, `replace_media`, `delete_media` and `request_upload` answer on the production
Authoring MCP server, which now carries 32 tools. Read calls were exercised against a real project:
listing pages in the store rather than reading the library whole, searching by name, filtering by
kind, and the snippets the tools hand back, including a video's poster frame. The write calls are
deployed but have not been run against a real library, and `publish` is still unproven against the
live server.

Two things changed here for that release. A customer's name and their site's address were in this
log and in four test fixtures; both now name the source kind rather than the customer, the way the
repository's own rule has always required. The contract extractor no longer defaults to one
person's home directory, and the repository states its licence.
