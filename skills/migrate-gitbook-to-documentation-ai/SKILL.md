# Migrate GitBook to Documentation.AI

## Start here

Read `references/how-a-migration-runs.md` first, in full. It carries what every migration shares: how to ask a person the four decisions (choices to click, never a sentence to type), the stages in order, the delivery flows, and what the migrator will not guess at. This skill adds only what is specific to GitBook.

Implemented source preference: **Git Sync repository** → live URL acquisition with the GitBook scrape profile (`.md` suffix first).

## What the adapter does
- Reads `.gitbook.yaml` (`root`, `structure.readme`, `structure.summary`, `redirects`) and `SUMMARY.md`: section headings become top-level groups, nested list items become nested groups, external links are skipped, missing targets and unlisted `.md` files are reported.
- `.gitbook.yaml` redirects become exact rules.
- Content goes through the Markdown adapter with `platform: gitbook`: `{% hint %}`, `{% tabs %}`/`{% tab %}`, `{% embed %}`, `{% content-ref %}`, `{% stepper %}`/`{% step %}`, `{% columns %}`/`{% column %}`, `{% updates %}`/`{% update %}` and `{% code %}` are converted outside code blocks, including inside blockquotes and after list items; mappings in `mappings/gitbook.yaml`.
- Live sites: the published `.md` is unwrapped (the `llms.txt` index line, the H1, the declared description paragraph and the trailing `# Agent Instructions` section are GitBook's, not the page's). Discovery folds each page's `.md` copy and every redirecting URL (group URLs, section `readme`/`welcome` paths) into the page it serves.
- GitBook's HTML encodings are read as what they are: `<table data-view="cards">` becomes cards (target and cover columns give `href` and `image`), `<a class="button">` a link, `<details><summary>` an Expandable title, `{% code title %}` a titled fence, `.md` page links the page path, and `broken://` links their text. Assistant prompts (`<button data-action="ask">`) are platform chrome and dropped by rule. A step's leading heading becomes its Step title (`titleType` h2/h3), which verify counts as that heading.
- What GitBook's published Markdown writes that MDX would misread is read as the author's text: a brace in prose (`{if} blocks`, a `{% openapi %}` quoted in escaped backticks, `(response) => { … }` in a table cell), a paragraph that opens with `import` or `export` (written back with its first letter as a character reference so the target reads it as prose too), an autolinked embed URL whose tail the export left outside the brackets (`<https://youtu.be/x>?`), and `{% file %}`, which is never closed. GFM footnotes (`[^1]` and `[^1]: …`) are carried as footnotes; the platform renders them and verify knows their anchors. An empty element with an `id` is kept as the anchor other links use.
- API reference: GitBook writes each operation, and each schema on a models page, as a fenced one-operation OpenAPI document. It becomes a static reference in the page: method and path, auth and parameters as `ParamField`, request body fields, and each response's fields as `ResponseField` (`$ref`/`allOf` resolved, nested objects in an Expandable). Any other JSON fence stays code. No group-level `openapi` spec is attached, so the pages keep their approved navigation and no playground is generated.

## Procedure
At every gate, ask the way the shared workflow says (`references/how-a-migration-runs.md`) says: a short summary, then choices the person can click, first option approves; on approval record it under the name they gave at the start and carry on with the next stages in the same turn. Never ask them to type "approve gate N".
1. `dai-migrate init ... --repo <git-sync-repo> --platform gitbook`
2. `dai-migrate discover` → **human gate 1/4**: review `plan/tree.yaml` and decide what to do with unlisted files (`inventory/platform-meta.json`).
3. `inventory` → `plan` → **human gate 2/4** → `assets` → `convert` twice → `nav` → local `verify` → **human gate 3/4** → `write --push` (or `publish` in the MCP flow) → `verify --preview` → **human gate 4/4** → `release` (writes the immutable cutover certificate) → `report`.

Not implemented: GitBook API export, variants and sections from `gitbook-docs.yaml` (map manually to versions and tabs in `plan/tree.yaml`), drawings, math, conditional content (T7 candidates).
