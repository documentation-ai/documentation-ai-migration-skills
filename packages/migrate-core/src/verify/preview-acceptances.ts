/**
 * Findings on the rendered preview that a named person looked at and accepted.
 *
 * The preview check fails a route only for something a reader would miss: a page that does not
 * load, a source passage or heading that is nowhere on it, a link into nothing. Even so, the check
 * reads a page the platform rendered, and a person looking at that page can see what a comparison
 * cannot: that the passage is there, drawn in a way the check does not read, or that the customer
 * has decided to live with it. `accept` records that decision against the route with who made it
 * and why; the next `verify --preview` reports the route as accepted rather than failing, and the
 * report names the person. Nothing is accepted silently, and nothing is accepted by a rule.
 *
 * The file lives beside the plans and is not pinned by convert: accepting a rendered page changes
 * no output, so it must not invalidate the conversion it was rendered from.
