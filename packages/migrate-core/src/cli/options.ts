export const HELP = `documentation-ai-migrate <command> [options]

Commands (run in order; the workflow has exactly four standard human gates):
  init         --workspace <dir> --source <url|path> (--clone <dir> | --remote <git url>) [--platform p] [--export <zip|dir>] [--fidelity exact|permissive] [--template classic|atlas] [--target customer-org|demo-org] [--allowed-orgs a,b] [--customer-authorised]
               --clone is your own clone of your Documentation.AI project's repository: the migration branch is built in it and
               pushed to its origin with your git credentials, and the platform previews the pushed branch by itself. No API key is needed.
               --remote names the repository instead, and the migrator clones it into the workspace.
               DAI_API_KEY (optional) lets the migrator look the preview URL up and check the project connection up front;
               without it the preview URL is read from the dashboard and passed to verify --preview-url.
               --allowed-orgs (or MIGRATION_ALLOWED_ORGS) lists the organisations a team may write to; without it a migration may
               write only to the organisation of the repository named here. --target defaults to customer-org.
               --template picks the site's look up front: classic (sidebar layout, the default) or atlas (denser navigation, content on a card);
               it is proposed in plan/site.yaml with the source's brand colours, logo and top-bar links, and can be changed there
  fingerprint  [--url <u>] [--export <zip|dir>] [--repo <dir>]     → plan/fingerprint.json
  discover     [--export <zip|dir>] [--url <u>] [--discovery-limit n] [--offline] [--exclude-help-system <root> --by "<who>"] → plan/tree.yaml [gate 1: scope]
               --offline rebuilds the tree and navigation from the frozen source already in the workspace; it fetches nothing
               --exclude-help-system (repeatable) records that a second help system published on the host is out of
               scope, with --by naming who decided; its pages are excluded with attribution instead of being placed by
               a sidebar that does not name them. The seed's own help system can never be excluded.
  approve      --gate <1-4> --by "<who>" [--note "<why>"]           records a human gate against the state it approves
  rebase       --reason "<why>"                                     re-pins the migrator build after a fix, keeps the frozen source
               and its acquisition pin, and stales every derivation; follow it with "discover --offline"
  acquire      [--fetcher local|firecrawl] [--zero-data-retention] [--profile p] [--urls file] [--proxy url] [--headers-file json] [--cookies-file file] → source-cache/acquired/
  inventory                                                         → snapshot/, inventory/*.json
  plan         [--mode preserve|restructure|hybrid] [--strip-prefix p] [--case preserve|lower] → plan/*.yaml [gate 2: conversion plan]
  assets       [--provider none|local|s3|dai-api] [--keep-external --by "<who>"] → plan/assets.json, assets-original/
               with no image hosting configured (no API key, no bucket), --provider none --keep-external --by "<who>" records
               a named person's decision to leave pictures at the addresses that serve them today; the report says so
  convert                                                           → output/, ledger/, quarantine/
  nav          [--place-unlisted --by "<who>"]                      → output/documentation.json, report/redirects.*.json, report/anchors.json
               [--help-center "<container>" [--hub-path <route>] --by "<who>"]
               opens that container on a help-centre hub: a page of category cards drawn from its own navigation
               --place-unlisted puts pages the source's own sidebar never named under the folders the source
               publishes them in, because the renderer serves only routes the navigation names. It states a
               structure the source's sidebar does not, so it records who decided and marks the navigation
               operator-reviewed; gate 1 must then be approved again for the tree it produced.
  write        [--repo <dir>] [--remote <url>] [--push] [--allow-lossy] [--no-wait] [--preview-timeout min] [--revision "<why>"] → refs/heads/migration/<session>; with --push waits for the preview deployment and records its URL
               --revision takes a new migration id for a build that supersedes the last push, recording why;
               a branch already pushed is evidence and is never rewritten
               --allow-lossy (permissive sessions) records the unproven exactness gates as waived in report/lossy-push.json
               a failing gate never withholds the push, in any mode: it is recorded in report/pushed-with-findings.json and blocks release
  project      [--project "<name or id>"]
               MCP flow, right after init: opens your browser to sign in to Documentation.AI and records which project this
               migration goes into (the only one you can edit, or the one named). It tells you at the start whether your account
               can edit the project, and it is what files hosted pictures under the right project.
  publish      [--project "<name or id>"] [--branch <working version>] [--remove-old-pages] [--no-wait] [--preview-timeout min]
               the MCP flow, instead of write --push: sends the output straight into your Documentation.AI project through the
               Authoring MCP server. No git and no API key: it opens your browser to sign in to Documentation.AI, the same way
               an assistant connects to the MCP server (the sign-in is kept in memory only). With several projects, name one
               with --project; it is remembered for this migration. DAI_API_KEY, when set, is used instead of signing in
               (for a machine nobody sits at) and also looks the preview address up.
               Everything lands on a working version of its own, published once; the platform then builds its preview. The
               live site is untouched until the working version is merged. A run that stops continues where it stopped.
               --remove-old-pages also deletes the pages the project had before.
  verify       [--preview] [--preview-url <u>] [--preview-contract-version v] → local [gate 3: pre-push] or preview [gate 4: release]; --preview uses the URL recorded by write
               [--renderer fetch|chrome] [--responsive sample|all|off]
               the preview check reads every page over HTTP (minutes, no browser needed). It fails a page only for what a reader
               would miss: it does not load, a source passage or heading is nowhere on it, a link leads nowhere. How the platform
               draws a page (labels on code blocks, captions, layout on a phone) is listed as a note and never fails.
               --renderer chrome opens each page in a headless browser and also checks content behind accordions and tabs (slower)
               --responsive measures phone/tablet/desktop layout on a spread of pages (default), on all of them, or not at all
  accept       --route <route> [--route …] --reason "<why>" --by "<who>"
               records that a named person looked at a preview finding and accepted it; verify --preview then reports the route
               as accepted instead of failing. Without --route, lists what has been accepted.
  release                                                            validates all four approvals and writes an immutable release certificate
  report       [--no-pdf] [--summary]                               → report/summary.md, report/platform-gaps.json,
               and the customer-facing report/customer-report.{html,pdf,json}: what was migrated,
               what did not carry over and why, and what still needs a customer decision.
               --no-pdf writes the HTML only (no browser needed)
               --summary writes the reader's version: verdict, numbers, decisions and checks, without the appendix, addresses or technical detail

  mcp                                                                serves the migrator to any MCP host over stdio (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Codex…):
               tools migration_guide, migration_status, migration_run, migration_read. Add it to the host as the command
               "npx documentation-ai-migrate mcp" run from this repository.

Every command except init and mcp takes --workspace <dir> (or MIGRATION_WORKSPACE).`;
