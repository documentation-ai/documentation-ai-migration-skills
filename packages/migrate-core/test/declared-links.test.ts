/**
 * Two kinds of link are written by rules rather than by the author, and they go opposite ways. A
 * link a handler draws between pages (a MadCap tile menu read from the table of contents) follows
 * those pages to their new routes. A link a rule writes by an operator's decision — a card to a live
 * tool that still lives on the source site — points there on purpose, and retargeting it turned it
 * into a link to the very page it sits on.
